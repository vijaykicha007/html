<br>Kapaleeswarar temple is a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva and Goddess Karpagambal. Karpagambal is a reincarnation of Goddess Parvathi. The Pallavas seem to have built this temple in the 7th century AD. As per the hymns composed by the Nayanars the temple was located along the shore side. The Nayanars are a group of 63 saints who are ardent devotees of Lord Shiva. This temple has references in early tamil texts that date to the 6th century AD.

As per historians this temple is supposedly the original temple. The Portuguese destroyed this temple in the mid 16th century. The Vijayanagara Kings rebuilt the Kapaleeswarar temple in the 16th century. This temple is now located about a km from the original temple and in the city of Mylapore.</p>

The east gopuram stands 120 feet high when compared to the smaller western gopuram. The gopuram has many colorful beautiful sculptures of the gods and goddesses. There is a large tank (kalyani) beside the temple. It is the largest water tank that I have ever seen beside a temple.

<mark>There is a shrine of all the Nayanars in bronze. Likewise there is an idol of the saint Sambandar at the entrance of the temple. Sambandar a saint of the 7th century is the most prominent of the 63 Nayanars. Saints Sambandar and Appar had sung hymns about this temple then.There are many vahanas (vehicles) and idols of gods (Ganesha and Karthikeyan) in this temple. The Punnai tree in this temple is the oldest tree in the city of Chennai. The ‘Parvathi and her penance’ section below covers this Punnai tree and its significance.</p>

<p><b>Brahma and his penance:
<br>As the legend goes … Brahma did not pay respect to Shiva over a meeting. This enraged Shiva who removed one of the heads of Brahma. Brahma then came down to Mylapore. As a part of his penance to please Shiva, Brahma installed a linga here. Lord Shiva has been worshiped ever since.</p>

<p><b>Parvathi and her penance:
<br>As per another legend, Shiva was narrating the significance of the Panchakshara Mantra to Parvathi. A dancing peacock catches her attention and distracts her. A furious Shiva curses Parvathi turning her into a peahen. As advised by Shiva, she performs penance in Mylapore to get rid herself of the curse.</p>
